Olympics Fantasy League

This is the client end of a fantasy team game built for the Paris Olympics 2024. It's built in Angular (typescript), with a Spring Boot backend. 

Users select five countries from five tiers and register a team. Once their email is verified, they will be added to the leaderboard. The backend registers the user and scrapes the olympic medal table to calculate their points. Users can view their points tally on the leaderboard page. Here they will see the global leaderboard, and how they rank against other competitors! 

For more information on how the game works or how the points are calculated please visit the "How it Works" page. Good luck!

    <h1>How Olympics Fantasy League Works</h1>
    <h2>Create Your Team</h2>
    <p>Your team is made up of five countries from five different tiers. The tiers have been decided based on the medal table from Tokyo 2020, 
        which you can view <a href="https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/olympic-games/en/results/all-sports/medal-standings.htm">here</a> to give you some hints.  </p>
       <p>The number beside each country is the number of participants they have at Paris 2024, for example Angola (20) means Team Angola are sending 20 athletes to Paris 2024.</p> 
   
    <p>Once you pick your countries, choose a team name, enter your email and password and click Register! And you're in!
        You should now be able to see your team on the leaderboard page.
    </p>
    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>Points are awarded based on the number of medals your countries win.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gold - 5 points</li>
        <li>Silver - 3 points</li>
        <li>Bronze - 1 point</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But, there's a catch! <b>Tier multipliers!</b> To make it more competitive, there are points multipliers for each tier, with the lower tier teams 
        having the potential to earn more points. The multipliers are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tier 1 - No multiplier</li>
        <li>Tier 2 - No multiplier</li>
        <li>Tier 3 - 2x</li>
        <li>Tier 4 - 3x</li>
        <li>Tier 5 - 5x</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Team Scoring Example</h3>
    <p>Team USA wins 10 gold, 5 silver and 3 bronze medals. Team USA is a Tier 1 country:</p>
    <li>Gold: 10 * 5 = 50</li>
    <li>Silver: 5 * 3 = 15</li>
    <li>Bronze: 3 * 1 = 3 </li>
    <li>Total points = 68</li>
    <p>Team Angola wins 1 gold, 1 silver and 0 bronze medals. Team Angola is a Tier 5 country:</p>
    <li>Gold: 1 * 5 = 5</li>
    <li>Silver: 1 * 3 = 3</li>
    <li>Bronze: 0 * 1 = 0 </li>
    <li>Total points = 8 * 5 (multiplier) = 40</li>
    <p> May the best team win</p>
